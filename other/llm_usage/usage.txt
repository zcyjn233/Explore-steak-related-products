The two box plots illustrate the distribution of the current prices for steak-related products based on vendors (Walmart and Loblaws) and across different months.

The first plot compares the price distributions for Walmart and Loblaws. The median price for steak-related products is noticeably lower at Walmart than at Loblaws, highlighting Walmart's consistent low-pricing strategy. Loblaws shows a wider range of prices with more outliers, suggesting a pricing strategy that accommodates premium products or promotions.

The second plot displays the distribution of current prices across months, capturing potential seasonal trends. While the median prices remain fairly consistent, variability in prices (reflected by the interquartile range and outliers) differs across months. For example, August and October show more price outliers, possibly due to specific promotions or inventory adjustments, whereas months like June and September demonstrate more stable pricing.

Together, these visualizations reveal insights into vendor-specific pricing strategies and seasonal variations, critical for understanding consumer and market behavior in the steak-related product segment.

Model Justification
The chosen model, a Bayesian linear regression implemented with the stan_glm function, is well-suited for analyzing the factors influencing the current price of steak-related products. Below are the key justifications for using this model and its specific design:

Model Type: A Gaussian family is appropriate for the response variable (current_price), which is continuous. This ensures the model can capture the variability in prices across vendors, months, and prior pricing strategies.

Predictor Variables:

Month: Captures seasonal variations in pricing, as highlighted by the observed fluctuations in monthly price distributions.
Old Price: Incorporates the relationship between historical and current prices, as shown by the scatter plot's positive trend.
Vendor: Accounts for systematic differences in pricing strategies between Walmart and Loblaws, as demonstrated by the vendor-specific box plot.
Bayesian Framework:

The use of informative priors (normal and exponential) ensures that the model incorporates prior knowledge while allowing the data to refine estimates.
Priors for the coefficients (normal(location = 0, scale = 2.5)) reflect a balanced assumption, allowing for flexibility while discouraging extreme coefficient estimates.
Interpretability:

The linear model structure allows for straightforward interpretation of the coefficients, providing insights into how each predictor influences current prices.
The inclusion of vendor and month enables direct comparisons of pricing strategies and seasonal trends.
Robustness:

The Bayesian approach ensures robustness in parameter estimation, particularly given the potential for variability and outliers in the dataset (as seen in both box plots and scatter plots).
The stan_glm framework provides reliable posterior distributions for all model parameters, offering a probabilistic understanding of the relationships.
Seed for Reproducibility:

Setting a seed (seed = 26) ensures consistent results, enhancing the reproducibility of the analysis.
This model is appropriate for addressing the study's objectives, capturing the effects of seasonality, vendor differences, and historical prices on the current price of steak-related products. The Bayesian approach further strengthens the model by providing uncertainty quantification, which is critical for actionable insights in retail pricing strategies.
